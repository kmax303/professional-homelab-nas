# NAS Module

This module includes the Docker-based self-hosted Nextcloud setup.  
Components:
- Nextcloud (web interface for file access and collaboration)
- MariaDB (database)
- Redis (performance caching)

All data volumes are mounted externally from the physical host and are configured for persistence.
